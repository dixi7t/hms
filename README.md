  - `SELECT` with `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `LIMIT`
  - `JOIN` queries across `guests`, `rooms`, `bookings`, and `payments`
  - `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations
- Tested query output in MySQL Workbench
- Handled foreign key constraint issues correctly
- Saved all queries in `week3_queries.sql` and committed to GitHub
